Stopping Sexual Assault is the Lowest Possible Goal for Title IX
===========================================
Some background for Interanacional Readers. Title IX is a Law, a Layer, that passed in J01972 that was meant to assure all students at 
Institutions receiving Federal Financial Aid the effective equivalent of an "Equal Rights Amendment" forbidding discrimination of opportunity
in any part of education⁺ on the basis of sex. 

It reads in part, "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance."

Institutions have successfully locked in a wide-range of more sex-equal and gender-equal Programs. Many people know of Title IX for its 
impact on Athletics Programs. Title IX demands equal recognition of physical development opportuniti²² for X|Y⁵ students. i know of Title IX
most acutely for its positive perverse effects on student disciplinary epistemology in the absence of Courtship Support and Campus Match.

There are too many education⁺ opportunity losses in the course of futile family formation search on Campus. 

Title IX Offices have generally claimed that it is not their general role to assist in family formation in any way. Yet, as an entity, the 
work of aiding and abetting "casualtied sex culture" as the "Majority  Project, Majority Product" on Campus practically, in bulk motion 
synthetic terms, makes family formation futile. Most people "go with the flow", particularly when the resources on campus supportive of better
flow are explained. The vast majority of students want to Marry (and will Marry) when indiviedual "binding affinity" exceeds threshold, having
learned the size of the set of potential Suitors | Prospects, with this sequence improved with optimal stop algorithms, which should be well
known as a Title IX construct, particularly in the mutual preference and Bayesian "forward expectancies" cases, as indiviedually experienced.




EtOH Policy: Calibration and Judicial Claims
============================================
This is a Family Friendly De'vice. It is not designed or intended to dissuade You from drinking ethanol. But it is designed to make the hazards of consent
far less haphazard, for everyone, and that requires that we exercise some foresight and get to the root of why⁵ claims emerge about EtOH, and how 

Will require all EtOH Claims be timestamped and, unless physically not possible because of institutional negligence, witnessed by RA or CPR soon enuf to 
backtrace and even recreate the metabolic curve metabolically with confidence, or explain missing data clearly and convincingly, or we'll presume the 
EtOH Claims are nullified by "nighttime estoppel". This implies a few things that might make You uncomfortable at first. 

Look, if You want to get drunk, and it's a better time for it, get drunk. If You want to get drunk and have drunken sex with Your Marriage, Engagement 
(or Late Engaugement) Partner, go for it. But please don't choose to have drunken sex first, before both of You have a chance to learn how to be naked
with each other without the timing complications of ethanol, and if You do go for drunken sex, make sure You're calibrated first, and make sure You take 
charge of whether You're able or not able to smartconsent. If You're so drunk You can hardly stand, then Yes, that's almost definitely rape. But You're not 
going to be able to prove Your claim without getting an ethanol reading in the form of a BAC or other reliable measure before the alcohol has cleared Your
body, barring a remarkable exemption in the data collection expectations we all have to abide by to keep this just and faer, for everyone. 

If You report that You've been aped or raped while drunk, to preserve the truth of the matter, if Your partner says it was concensual and You allege that 
You weren't able to give consent, You can only argue You weren't able to give consent if You're willing to:
☐ Give up on fuzzy math, 
☐ Lock a BAC datapoint down in advance of situations where You might want another to "sense consent" for You with BACTrak or another Sensor, 
☐ Get drunk and steep in experimental conditions as an Innocenter, 
☐ Propose a plan of reform action on Your campus, and adequately plan some administrative follow-thru, to make sure this particular series of events doesn't 
happen again. 

The last may mean working hard to đelta culture, sometimes. That may also mean reaching Us at smartconsent.org to tell Your story to Us too, so 
we can adapt to it with this hardware-software-policy mixture. We're not reliable, at smartconsent.org, but we can see things in weis that Campus 
Administrators may not be able to empathize with and act upon alone, and we may carry tremendous influence over campus policies like this someday, where no
intervening Religious or Campus Branch logic exists on temperence requirements, and that's important.

Look, people often act more drunk than they are while at Parties. The disinhibition prompts playful exaggeration by many, and to fully situate this
problem, You have to realise that there are confounds and playful indulgences that can turn into a histrionic weapon unfaerly, and there are abundant
contests of fact over this very question.. so many, that We need to change the locus of control to before consent situationals, slow consent down
some in any case where there could possibly be ambiguity, calibrate everyone so drinking stays within tolerated and non-debilatitive ranges, make 
for better-quality consent options, establish drink substitutes and altarnatives (the "Morning After"™ Nonalcoholics Family Approved by Campus), and
apply any other strong, worthwhile Reform Theses that Conversations might bear for the purposes of settling these Problems at their Roots.

Y⁵ do we need an x-ample metabolic calibration curve post-experience? i hate having You stop at Title IX to get drunk under controlled conditions. 

We'll need to backfill Your metabolic clearance time and contribute to the data 
on precisely the line to draw on EtOH Calibration and Campus* EtOH Protocol with reguard to checkconsent's equilibrium with both dumbconsent and null 
consent. This area of unknowable black swan egalitarian threat is so wishy-washy it kills me. You don't have mysterious neurobiology. 
All of Your EtOH Claims are, to my knowledge, calcuble, recalcuble, and preventable, with a small dose of wisdom, and an even smaller dose of wisdom
if EtOH Firms Cooperate on Beautiful and Simple Point-based Labelling Standards (e.g. {3/1} - 3 points per serving, 1 serving in this container) that match up
to a three-number summary of disablement thresholds per person, with limited tolerance-character assumed or allowed, because there's only very small 
tolerance adjustment, i presume, in the absence of metabolic damage, until shown otherwise with data i can root-trace. 

My key point is this: As of now, now that You have this de'vice in Your room, and with Calibration or Branch / Indiviedual Opt-Out, Opt-in completed in 
advance, a loss of consciousness while drinking with a later claim of nonconsent reflects very poorly on You, on Your Relationship with Your Partner, 
Your Campus, and Your Relationships within Campus Culture. All four. Refusal to evidence, quantitatively, Your instant EtOH at a given timepoint 
before it leaves Your system will almost always, at a first stroke policy, be decent cause for throwing the claim out, unless a endoneurobiologist, 
functional sociocognitive psychologist, or better can explain to me X-X-Y⁵-Y⁵ this can't be eliminated from the Claim Set with Preventive Heuristics, 
Environmental Distributed Cognition, Just-in-Time Design, and Proactive Data Collection in an "Sexual Experience Survey" Reporting Regime that supports
much finer discrimination between case types, indexed to EtOH Threshold Rules, with some Clearance for Proven Exceptionalities in either direction. 

So, to summarize: drink on, and enjoy Yourselves, as You will, but please do not try voiding Your own responsibilities on sageconsent by claiming 
EtOH removed Your Sense of Judgment, without providing Us with a completely accurate picture as to how this occurred, down to a lightning quick reading
of Your BAC, and a recreation of the EtOH Metabolic Curvature Conditions under which this occurred. i can't, at this point, eliminate all EtOH Claims
with prophylactics with perfect confidence, but my belief is that We will be able to do so soon, together, but for the most oddball situations, and 
scenarios that take place out of tended housing. 

If You're Off-Campus and Unaffiliated with a Diverseiti Institution, the PPS (Parent-Polis Support Officers, aka Police) will be able to take an EtOH
Measure if You reach out immediately, and that Timestamped Measure will then be followed up, ideally, with a calibration test on EtOH Clearance before
any Prosecution takes place over intoxication gradients that are, Title IX Officers believe, in between "drunk" and "so senselessly drunk it's insensible 
to ask for, accept, or attain consent". It would be a nightmare getting an undecidable case that involves someone who says they were too drunk to give 
consent but doesn't give the investigation steam enuf to actually go on, like near-precise drinks and careful drink counts, or a BAC marker or two. i don't
want to hear from Campus Title IX steams complaining about student drinking or facilitating student complaints about judgment loss under the influence 
if they haven't Calibrated the Campus Yet, like a 1st Year Physics Student would do. Do Campus Calibrations.. students are just not supported in their 
"heuristic_master branch" choices Yet, and they need to be, or uncareful, atrocious counting techniques or non-counting will lead to these situations from 
the last 30, 40 Years, pre-Title IX Triage, pre-Calibration. i know how this works, having binged once or twice myself. There's no trustworthy "street 
knowledge" on personal tolerance except "trial by hangover". Let's stop the "trials by hangover", and just run harm less opt-in/opt-out "calibration trials",
instead. 

* Campus: When i say, "Campus" or "Campus Housing", what i really mean is not just Campus but generally all Housing and In-Bedded Settings, of all kinds.


Campus Judiciary Process Needs Not Just Vacuous "Reform", but Standardization under a InteraNacional Student Bill of Rights and Rites
=======================================================================================================================

The author is currently "suiting" (truly, taking action against) the Trustees of The University of Pennsylvania, et. al. for failing to 
establish a basically safe culture for romantic calmunication⁺, and instead creating an epistemology that was designed, from top to bottom, 
to exclude a Y⁵ from the benefits of an education program and be subjected to groupish, multilayer institutional discrimination, inclusive of 
engineering a culture in which my candidacy as a graduate / professional student would be crushed under degenerate, untestable, unresponsive, 
irresponsible, backhanded, deliberately inconclusive, hostilely reductive institutional forces, down to the level of breaching procedure after
procedure to favor an episteme that would, as near as possible, assure what the Institution would presume to be a "win" for the X and an 
inescapable "professional death" shaming ritual for the Y⁵. This can be done with extended Prisoner's Dilemmas, hiding of evidence, obscuring
process rights with refusals of non-confederated advising support, forbidding "hi road" and "double-duty families" advocates from taking 
charge of assembling cases in standard media form, refusing measurements of evidence base collection rule neutrality, maintaining a posture 
of infallibility, refusing to disclose the material weaknesses in one-sided root-cause inculpation indoctrinations, refusing apology patterns
of confrontation and conciliation that are generally religiously most natural in Hh CORE (see "The Socratic Apology", augmented by Your Branch
culture on effectuating calmunity⁵ truth, prevention strategy, and memory, with or without scapegoating), creating a patchwork evidence 
gathering strategy that hardly any Ivy League School had standardized together into a Shared Conscience Protocol in or before 011, and more. The 
"more" includes, but is not limited to, the recognition of rampant unmet needs in Just Care Systems on the question of facilitating Family 
Layer Building with highly humane mechatronic supports, inclusive of basic graph theory on edge-weight and shared directedness, basic and 
extended relational schema exchange with SI interconnects in Institutions that profess to be diverse, calendrically representable timeplots, 
a preference toward a 10 checkpoint system before Marriage, and altarnatives to what i consider to be best, the "until death do us part" 
mentality, that permit a Recommitment of Vows, with or without a ReSupportive Cohort Review for those Marriages that are færtile, at the 25 
Y⁵ear + Birth ∱Pacing Mark.

The list of "charges" i can assemble, on behalf of a SCHRODINGER STATE, against the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania under the guise
of providing Equal Opportunity to Education⁺ is enormous. The basic absence of any other altarnative on Valiant's Day and Vweek, and the 
presence of an "honesty and sincerity check" re:authentication assignment of need, should have been enough to have effected an immediate 
release. The Assembly of a Female Review Board should have been evidence of scrupulosity and care, not "mens rea". But it wasn't, and one 
student almost died trying to keep h|er patients and h|er counterpart's patients alive thru a process that presumed character smears and 
gossip chains were freely available, instantly protectively deniable with a "In my opinion.." dropped before the claim, 
"the Hearing Panel should have found h|er responsible for all that which s|he had been charged", continuing on to argue that the Hearing Panel
must have "set the evidence aside" but that, Institutionally, the student (me) can be allowed to register. This, to the Person who would 
ultimately summarize and effectively decide, one way or another, my character and fitness for medical school. 

What's more, this knockout sequence prevented me from giving voice and organization, in a natural, face-to-face way, my thought-feelings for 
another that were branch asymptotically approaching a Marriage Proposal, complicating them enormously with a defensive-offensive grid 
expectation that was not harm less and was hopelessly insoluble under ethical expenditures of student time, particularly in this yoked 
Prisoner's Dilemma case. My voice is conditioned by the person whom i'm forced by physically coercive circumstance to address. If i'm forced 
to endlessly address a Disciplinary Officer, or a Disciplinary Panel, rather than a loved one or a loved one who feels betrayed, someone whose
reactions, from facial blush to gurgling smile (or to discontent) i can see face to face, my ability to form and reform, frame and reframe 
my understanding of truth in connection to my other half and my other memory of the most pregnant question, as i always must, i can not do so
without oh.io realization in total consideration of the system of swirling, startling institutional and indiviedual identities and projected 
needs that motivate the ties that bind. One matter, for instance, that never reached consideration at the Hearing Panel was whether it was 
conscientiously wise for a Pediatrics Candidate to suggest, to a beloved protége, that they raise children together before entering the 
field of Pediatrics, which depends and relies so much on parental insights gathered over time-on-task caring for children's total needs. For 
students planning to specialize in Pediatrics, with Mentors from Pediatrics who made this choice themselves, it's a natural, noble, necessary, 
and +normal question to ask, but one that never reached consideration on Y⁵ i would be, near the end of my time as a Postbacc Core Health
Studies Student of Fe²⁶Mn²⁵ist bearing, reflecting on the Most Important Question taking for granted, at this point, my commitment to 
the pursuit of a differential on Life-and-Death chains of decisional prevention, and a readily ascertainable multiplier effect that emerges 
from Courtship with another of the same Projected Lifelong Care Commitment.

(For full disclosure, this timing was also seperately reinforced by a younger brother just married, an additional well-known human herstory 
pressure gradient on marriage ∱pacing that my New Year's and Branch Valiant Day Partner had known of by indirect reference since Thanksgiving,
and that all persons and certainly all scholarly institutions know everywhere has an effect, by virtue of "sibling - grandparent" wish signal,
one that could be better co:ordinately timed preventively with primarily cohort-∱aged ☾almuniti²² Courtship Match. This, as well as so many 
other pressures that humanity⁵ deleteriously experience rather unevenly or asymmetrically⁵, can be lessened or released with cohort pacings 
overriding and overwriting the current Yb⁷⁰ "Mutational Marriage" Pressure Models.) 

in light of my experiences, in light of the facts, i do not trust Disciplinary Systems, not Yet, to do what's right under conditions of doubt 
and cultivated mistrust, particularly in the absence of an InteraNacional Student Bill of Rights and Rites that matches the Teachings of 
Ordered Liberty, as procedurally mechanized, that are taught in Public (and Private) Schools. 

Disciplinary Systems have become cesspools where the chaos of casualtied community hazards are thrown, with unremediable shames, often, being 
the "killing blow" that keeps the Institution's name out of the Papers of Court when aimed against students whose identities are almost by 
definition still very vulnerable to shaming, in a juridical system that is not affordable (a Coase property-taking dysequilibrium that students 
can not put up adequate collateral or reach bounded rationality cause to n-act an adequate opportunity for a re:tort in Court, if the Bill of 
Rights and Rites has been breached), capping the Affected Student's Pursuit of Higher Education⁺ in manners that the 
Department of Education⁺ was either not well-equipped to trace and even DOE n-couraged, in U|S⁺ recent herstories, by victim advocacies seeking 
to raise the false positive, true negative, and true positive rates with more sensitization of Institutions under liability, without effecting
the most obvious thing, a bedside button for reporting these cases that were motivating procedural lapse, procedural breach, and procedural 
charge change, so as not to leave reports brewing overnight.. with altaring and altering branch logic choices offered and afforded, and with 
motivation trending toward calmuniti rectification and rebonding, in most all non-sociopathic cases, under innocenter <-> innocentest dynamics
of honest, sincere, genuine root-searching, problem-solving conversation rather than calmunity shunnings built on one-time, double-faced 
late complaint rituals, in the absence of safeti²² nets for the psychological burdens that X and Y⁵ must face in the navigation of common 
Courter | Courted decision tree leaks. 

The DOE Evidentiary Rule of Preponderance of Evidence was always a ridiculous matter to assert without also achieving well-specified and 
well-standardized Discovery Rights and Rites, rather than a patchwork of uneven, occluded, assymetric discovery options, in which any case 
launched across a gender or sex divide would leave one party (the X) enjoying Special Spies and Spying Services, and the other having no 
return feedback for ages to validate that "database commits" to institutional trunk memory were accepted as valid and true, for lack of any 
countersigning authoriti²² in the room. Institutions act like middle schoolers sometimes, picking food fights or allying with the first person 
who told a fragment of a story under time pressure when they should be designing a better world.  The "Preponderance of Evidence" Standard is 
particularly inept without specifying exactly how this "Preponderance of Evidence" would be gathered neutrally, by well-trained or
well-coached "Discoverers of Evidence", and how media and medium preference gaps will be negotiated in the absence of each indiviedual's other 
(in this case, Better) half. If there are mounds of evidence or nonevidence that a student does not know how to attain or establish without 
direct, face-to-face confrontation and conciliation with their innocenter, they're so often told that that base of evidence won't be allowed 
into the room, or will be concealed with the conceit of a privacy veil, effectively transforming one Party into a fragile victim, rather than
what the underlying case might be, a fundamentally violated or volatile personality that must, in fact, face the person whom they plan on 
innocentesting in order to secure the human interreaction that every observer in the room is accustomed to relying upon to judge character 
and expose and unravel restricted codes, or that the innocenter and innocentest might use to establish that the Juridical System was 
instantiated under an ignorance, and that that ignorance is adequate enough to suspend the Proceedings, and allow for a word between
those who seemed, at first, to the Institutional Officials, to be on opposite sides of an Aisle, when there was much in a conversational 
chasm that would have closed hidden and private logic only exposable in the company of a confidante and protegé.

i can write hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of pages articulating what happens when fundamental færness in disciplinary procedure is
broken, and indeed, i already have. But it would have only taken a few, very strongly protected preventive lines of coordinate control loop 
structure that, as a Human Being and U|S⁺ Citizen, i was born to expect to have access to in resort against oppressive, tyrannical, arbitrary, capricious
"groupish |man in the middle" attacks by Institutions that take on the belief that institutionalized alternative aggression is a finer, better
course than coordinated, timely, branchwise altaration for true family and Family commitments. My life was forfeit to and made vulnerable 
not just by Institutional Overreach, but also by the preconditions on that Institutional Overreach, which trace back to |he said, |he said 
dishonest, cynically self-protective behaviors by students embroiled in a dispute, thinking that a Li³ could serve as social grease on 
the application or release of an Institutionally Perverse Patronizing Care Model. If the Office of Student Conduct will only help You if You
make the Office of Student Conduct believe the worst, and leave out the good parts, You might leave out the good parts, in print at least, 
under n-couragement. Likewise, if the University won't understand that the word "Stop" does not always mean "Stop" in all contexts. The 
Innocenter in my case said "Stop" once in the Library when i was trying to ascertain h|is reaction to a beta-crystal gift given, in local 
(not global) scope. That's one thing i think i forgot or neglected to tell the Panel or the Disciplinary System, because:
a) it was their job to bring it up, if they were investigating or prosecuting adequately; and, 
b) though i would have normally discussed it fully and completely, as the Contracts of the Disciplinary System, in a refusal of 5th Amendment 
"Right to Silence in 'Custody of Career Arrest' Custodial Interrogation" as well as the complete chain of codified interpretations in that 
context, it was too easy to turn the word "Stop" into a "Shouldn't s|he have known.." think less battle cry over a codon wobble with two 
∱pace-different outcomes, by those who are not inclined to spend more energy than necessary thinking thru the complexities of an error stack 
that, on one hand, was proximate to an unvoiced Marriage Proposal, and on the other, carried a very real Threat of Lifelong Ostracism from 
the only Subdivision of Higher Education⁺ that fully aligned with my Shopcraft, Soulcraft and HhÅÆJ Medical and Bioethical Values Disclosure 
on Applying to the Federally Subsidized Educational Program that i was enrolled within.

"Stop" is, for the record, one of the most common things my little |brother might say when |he's wrong and doesn't want to admit it or tired 
of talking and wants to change the subject, and/or wants a break from logic or what |he might perceive to be illogic, 
with or without granting the speaker enuf time to complete a case for nonchange (or change) on whatever matter we're taking different 
perspectives or presenting different arguments on. i hear "Stop" from my siblings all the time, and did all the time i was growing up. People
say "Stop" in libraries when they feel like they're being distracted. They also say it when they don't understand or are ignorant of what 
they were given, and won't allow the giver to get a word in with edge-wise and sincerity hinge test logic, to troubleshoot the most critical
question any human being can ask another, in the context of everything else that had happened between them in the weeks just before. 

i speak of this here, now, in the "palicies.h" header, so that You'll understand some of the possible choices i may have to make to assure
a conclusion to these destructive facets of education⁺ institutions when they turn into an operational mode that is more "Sine moribund, 
ledgers vanæ" than "Tolle Leges! Et sine moribus, leges vanæ". 

i will not sell SSC Consoles or SSC Compatible Consoles or Hardware. i will not. i will "long-term lease" them to Trustees, like Boeing and 
Airbus do with ærorplanes. i'll retain them as their Owner, and the Trustees of Each Institution will be Responsible for managing their 
maintenance and service. If Breaches in Disciplinary Procedure warrant it, in calmunication⁺ with Student Governments and a minimal viable 
stanhubs, client 
devices building on and enabled by the conceptual work and intellectual property encoded in Si/OWTcB, and all those tools to meet a cleary 
expressed, functional bedside need for safeti²² microcontrollers within this population, for this particular need, that become obvious thereby. 
i will do my utmost to make sure that i'm fair and fær both to the numerous cases that i caused that could have been reported and weren't, 
for lack of this obviating and preventative report technology, and to the thoroughly mirms. i don't know who that would be in these circumstances, but i trust in the Matchmakers, and it's the primary point on which my life
remains remediably splinter.ed by a gap between calm intention and the full-bodied conscience-assured behavior that comes from accompaniment 
thru life with a full-bandwidth store of complementarily⁵ altared living memory, navigating life under an evenly shared yoke.
