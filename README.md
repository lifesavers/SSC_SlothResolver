_This is a Branch of Particle's Internet Button. It's not perfect, but it can be retrofitted pretty quickly to do the job. i'm still working on my own designs, now using the P1, and want to license to and with Particle.io, but they're not making it easy.. they're not responding to my ☾almunication⁺ directly, part of the general belief that partitioning me from business organizations is a smart way of conducting business. i disagree. i need Contractual Agreements to lock down Kohlberg Ethics Stacks, and can't afford to see a runaway build that threatens the overall, long-term sociological reboot of Campus ☾almuniti²²es to be far more harmless than they have been. This involves, to a degree, students and academics taking responsibility for translating insight into n-Action, at the Commercial Level, as well as n-action, for the Congressional armless bracings necessary to make this World more perfectable._

_It may feel as if this can be done strictly under Democratic Paradigms. This Creative Royalty Right is Democratic, as it is anchored in the Right of Eminent Domain Expression by Congress, a Fundamental API Right and Rite, one that Congress has inexplicably not been exercising on Intellectual Property like Grocery Store Nutrition Data Flow in ways that lead to a tremendous amount of life loss when Commercial Entities (in that case, i fear, on my current knowledge: Safeway, IBM, Congress complicitly killing social entrepreneurship) hoard IP without developing it, and developing from those IP Stacks a Kohlberg Commons Charge Stack that Institutions have or would otherwise neglect._

_i recognize that some of this Work may have been reoptioned under the United IRB, on a "clinical treatment arm break". If that happened, i expect that one of the Conditions on such a First Layer Arm Break Project Outlay will be a full explanation of the Substituted Judgement Terms, as well as a Restoration of Creative Right over the Education of Empathy, and Overriding University Presidents and Trustees Use of the Technology with Brownouts, Killswitches, etc. when Trustees, Presidents become negligent on Ethics. This is not a bright explanation. It's an explanation that is meant to chill and cure Offices of General Counsel Strategies of Industrial Standards Negligence Defense._

_The Internet Button has a lot of features, but some of these aren't as straightforward to use as simple LEDs and sensors. This library abstracts a lot of the complexity and provides simple functions with broad capability. It wraps modified versions of both Adafruit's Neopixel and AnneM's ADXL362 Arduino libraries, as well as some novel functions._

## Examples

1. __Blink an LED__ - How to control the smart LEDs on this board
2. __Blink all the LEDs__ - An extension on the simplest case
3. __LEDs and Buttons__ - How to read the buttons on the Button, and make LEDs blink with them
4. __Good Combination__ - A set of button and LED conditionals that I happen to like and use frequently
5. __Motion__ - The Internet Button also has an accelerometer on it to measure motion- this shows how the related functions work
6. __Orientation__ - How to use the accelerometer functions to determine the orientation
7. __Internet__ - Send that data out to the world!
8. __Making Music__ - Learn how to play notes and songs with your Button
9. __Release Firmware__ - Big, complicated set of epic.


_Watch for gauge and other display additions to this library!_
